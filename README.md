After beginning to create the website, I realized that this layout wouldn't work as well as I'd like. Instead of using Cards for each section, I've decided to give them their own sections so that the website can scroll down for a while. This will make editing and use much easier. Below is the new concept of the page's structure.

Loosely following the previous design, I decided that it was fine to have cards in the projects section. I added the About and Contact sections just like depicted. The about section needs a lot of work; I'm not sure what to put in it to be frank. That's a question for my instructors. The contact section has thumbnail placeholders that bring the user to my github or open the user's email client to email me. In the future I may add more of these things, but for now this will do. Below is an image of the current design.

At this point in the project I've decided to leave the image of myself at the white sands as is. It's fun and represents me best, so I think it's ok to keep it there for now.
